## Shuffle Puzzle

# A memory game in which you gain points by clicking on cards, but you lose all your points when you click a card more than once.

To gain as many points as possible you have to remember which cards you've clicked, as the cards will shuffle order when you click them. When you've clicked all available cards, you will move to a new level of randomly chosen cards.
